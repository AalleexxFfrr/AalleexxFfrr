### âœ¨ What's cookin', good lookin'? âœ¨
### ðŸŒ± I am currently studying Business Informatics at The Faculty of Business and Management at The Brno University of Technology (BUT) in Czech Republic.
### âš¡ I don't have enough programming in my faculty, so I take courses from other faculties: The Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, The Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication and The Faculty of Information Technology because I really love programming.
### ðŸ¤” I want to become a DevOps Engineer.
### ðŸ”­ Also I'm learning programming on Coursera, Codecademy and Leetcode.
### ðŸ’¬ That is, as you could already understand, here will be all of these: my university's tasks/homeworks, projects from coding platforms, my own pet projects, some somplex projects that I can only repeat and try to modify.
### ðŸ˜„ So, you can follow me and see my code if you want. That's the beauty of open-sourse. I wish you good luck!
