### ✨ What's cookin', good lookin'? ✨
### 🌱 I am currently studying Business Informatics at The Faculty of Business and Management at The Brno University of Technology (BUT) in Czech Republic.
### ⚡ I don't have enough programming in my faculty, so I learn it at home.
### 🤔 I want to become a DevOps Engineer.
### 🔭 Also I'm learning programming on Coursera, Codecademy and Leetcode.
### 💬 That is, as you could already understand, here will be all of these: my university's tasks/homeworks, projects from coding platforms, my own pet projects, some somplex projects that I can only repeat and try to modify.
### 😄 So, you can follow me and see my code if you want. That's the beauty of open-source. I wish you good luck!
